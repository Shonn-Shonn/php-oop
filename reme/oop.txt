The process of creating a new object -> instantiation 

$app = new FbAccount();

Properties -> public $name; 

Methods -> public function methodName()

abstract -> abstract public function methodName()

A CLASS IS A BLUEPRINT FOR CREATING OBJECTS;

new keyword to create an object from a class

$this variable reference the current object of the class


SHOULD USE encapsulation 

data protection 
->by defining properties as private or protected
you restrict access to those properties only through
specific methods(getters and setters)
------PREVENT unauthorized modifications
